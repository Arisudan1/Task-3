Task Title: To-Do App Development
Task Description: The goal of this project was to develop a functional To-Do app that 
allows users to add, edit, delete tasks, and mark tasks as priorities and completed. 
Additionally, tasks should be saved locally to ensure they persist across sessions.
Steps Taken:
1. Designed the HTML structure for the app, including input fields and a list to display 
tasks.
2. Styled the app using CSS to enhance its appearance and usability.
3. Implemented the core functionality with JavaScript, including adding, editing, 
deleting, prioritizing, and marking tasks as completed.
4. Used local storage to save and retrieve tasks, ensuring data persistence.
Challenges Faced:
1. Local Storage Integration: Ensuring that tasks were properly saved and loaded from 
local storage.
2. Edit Functionality: Creating an intuitive way for users to edit existing tasks.
3. Prioritization and Completion Logic: Implementing a clear visual indicator and 
logic for task prioritization and completion.
Solutions Implemented:
1. Utilized JSON.stringify and JSON.parse to handle complex data structures in local 
storage.
2. Used prompt for task editing and ensured task list updates were reflected 
immediately.
3. Added priority and completion toggle features that visually mark tasks and update 
local storage accordingly.
Learnings:
1. Gained deeper understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
2. Improved skills in working with local storage for data persistence.
3. Enhanced knowledge of CSS for creating a user-friendly interface.
Project Update: The To-Do app is fully functional with features for task management, 
including adding, editing, deleting, prioritizing, and marking tasks as completed, along with 
local storage integration for data persistence. Future improvements could include more 
advanced UI features, such as drag-and-drop for task reordering and a better editing interface
